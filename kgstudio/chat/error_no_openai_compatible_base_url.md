### OpenAI Compatible Base URL Required

You selected OpenAI Compatible as your LLM Provider, but no Base URL is configured.

How to fix:
- Go to **Settings ⚙️ → General → OpenAI Compatible Server**
- Enter the **Base URL** for your provider (e.g., `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions` for OpenRouter, `http://localhost:11434/api/chat` for Ollama, etc.)

After updating your settings, try your request again.
