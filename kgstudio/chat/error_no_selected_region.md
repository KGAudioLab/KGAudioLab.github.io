### No MIDI Region Selected

Please select a MIDI region in your track to continue.

The K.G.Studio Musician Assistant Agent can only add, remove, or edit notes within the boundaries of the selected region. Ensure your region's start and end beats covers the musical section you want to work on. The agent will focus its edits within this region, though it may reference music outside the selection if needed for context.

When the agent is not working well, try to reduce the region size to limit the scope of the agent's work.

**Region Operations:**
- Double-click in a track to create and select a new MIDI region.
- Click on an existing region to select it.
- Use the Piano button to open and work with the currently active region in the piano roll.

After selecting a region, please try your request again.
